# About Me
Welcome to my github, I am a student developer with an interest in machine learning and data analysis. I am currently working on several cool projects.

# My Projects
## Soar Learning (Private)
An Ionic React project designed for student pilots to learn all they need to for the five mandatory theoretical tests to get their microlight license. [Link](https://google.com) 

## Text Recognition
This text recognition software was originally designed for my A-Level CS project. It uses raw HTML/CSS/JS for both the neural network and text recognition.

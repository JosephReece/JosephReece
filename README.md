# About Me
Welcome to my github, I am a student developer with an interest in machine learning and data analysis. I am currently working on several cool projects.

# My Projects
## Soar Learning (Private)
An Ionic React project designed for student pilots to learn all they need to for the five mandatory theoretical tests to get their microlight license. [Link](https://github.com/JosephReece/Soar)

## Text Recognition
This text recognition software was originally designed for my A-Level CS project. It uses raw HTML/CSS/JS for both the neural network and text recognition. It uses no 3rd party APIs or libraries.

  - [Neural Network](https://github.com/JosephReece/Neural-Network)

## Messaging Software
This Python Script sends messages between users on the same network given their IP. Messages are sent after using a diffie-hellman public key exchange, then an XOR SHA-256 encryption.

## Small Projects
On this account you also may see other smaller projects.

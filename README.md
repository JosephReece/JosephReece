# About Me
Welcome to my github, I am a student developer with an interest in machine learning and data analysis. I am currently working on several cool projects.

# My Projects
## Soar Learning (Private)
An Ionic React project designed for student pilots to learn all they need to for the five mandatory theoretical tests to get their microlight license.

## Text Recognition/Neural Network
This text recognition software was originally designed for my A-Level CS project. It uses raw HTML/CSS/JS for both the neural network and text recognition.

## Messaging Software (Not Yet Added to Profile)
This Visual Basic .Net project sends messages between users on the same network given their IP. Messages are encrypted using diffie-hellman encryption.

## Small Projects
On this account you also may see other smaller projects.
